# Dependencies Directory

Any third-party scripts should be placed in this directory. In most projects, these will be managed by a package manager, such as [Bower](http://bower.io/), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/), or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) (Ignia typically uses Bower for client-side dependencies).

> *Note:* Server-side dependencies will typically be installed in their own directory, such as `node_modules` (for sites using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Ignia typically uses the package manager's default directory for these.
