# Styles Directory

Any pre-process stylesheets will go in this directory. For Bootstrap based projects, this means the Boostrap LESS distribution; for most other projects, it will be Sass files.

## Files
Typically, the base directory structure will include:
````
+- /Base
+- /Components
+- /Helpers
+- /Layout
+- /Overrides
+- /Vendor
+- /Views
+- _variables.scss
+- Style.scss
````
