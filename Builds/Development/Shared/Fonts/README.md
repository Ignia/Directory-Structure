# Fonts Directory

The location for any fonts associated with the site.

## Files
It is recommended that fonts be organized into directories based on font family. That way, individual styles and formats are grouped together. For instance, a directory called `Helvetica Neue` might include:
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.eot`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.otf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.svg`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.ttf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.woff`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdExO.eot`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdExO.otf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdExO.ttf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdExO.svg`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdExO.woff`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-MdExO.eot`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-MdExO.otf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-MdExO.ttf`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-MdExO.svg`
- `HelveticaNeueLTStd-MdExO.woff`

> *Note:* It is generally recommended that the font file names defined by the font foundry be maintained, unless they are ambiguous.
