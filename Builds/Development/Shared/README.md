# Shared Directory

The location for any files that are shared across the site. This typically includes `/Fonts`, `/Scripts`, and `/Styles`. It may also include `/Global` if importing files from Ignia's global code repository.

> *Note:* `/Scripts` and `/Styles` will typically be populated by the build process based on pre-processed files located in `/Source`.

> *Note:* This does not include images (which are stored in `/Images`) or views (which are stored in `/Views`).
