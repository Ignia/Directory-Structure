# Images Directory

The location of any images used on the site.

> *Note:* For most web-development projects, the original, non-optimized images will be stored in the `/Images` folder. These will be copied to `/Production/Images/` during the production build process. During this time, they will typically be minified (e.g., using [Pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/)).

> *Note:* This folder should only be used for shared images; images that are specific to particular pages should be stored in an `/Images` folder in the same directory as the page itself. This requirement does not apply to MVC and/or SPA sites.
