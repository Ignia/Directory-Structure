# Builds Directory

Location of compiled or post-processed files. For Ignia's standard build process, this includes `Development` and `Production`.

> *Note:* When working with .NET projects in Visual Studio, this requires retargeting the default `Debug` and `Release` folders.

> *Note:* For projects under source control, the `/Builds` directory will typically be excluded (e.g., via a `.gitignore` file)
