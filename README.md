# Ignia Directory Structure

As Ignia collaborates with a variety of developers, having a consistent, predictable organizational structure for projects is critical. This project establishes the baseline directory structure for all Ignia projects; particular *types* of projects such as AngularJS or Microsoft MVC applications build upon this foundation.

## Directories
- [x] [Builds](./Builds/)
  - [ ] [Development](./Builds/Development/)
  - [ ] [Production](./Builds/Production/)
- [ ] [Source](./Source/)
  - [ ] [Styles](./Source/Styles/)
  - [ ] [Scripts](./Source/Scripts/)
  - [ ] [Dependencies](./Source/Dependencies/)
