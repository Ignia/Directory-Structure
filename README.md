# Ignia Website Structure

As Ignia collaborates with a variety of developers, having a consistent, predictable organizational structure for projects is critical. This project establishes the baseline directory structure for all Ignia projects.

> *Note:* Particular *types* of projects, such as AngularJS or Microsoft MVC applications, will expand upon this foundation; this will typically be done as part of a boilerplate project.

## Directories
- [x] [Builds](./Builds/)
  - [x] [Development](./Builds/Development/)
  - [x] [Production](./Builds/Production/)
- [x] [Source](./Source/)
  - [x] [Styles](./Source/Styles/)
  - [x] [Scripts](./Source/Scripts/)
  - [ ] [Dependencies](./Source/Dependencies/)

> *Note:* Checked items are expected to exist on every Ignia website.
